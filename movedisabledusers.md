This will query AD for all disabled users either in an active searchbase or everywhere.  It will then move those accounts to a path you designate.  It works well to move all old user accounts to a designated area and out of active AD areas.

Make sure to update the $searchbase variable or remove it from the $userstomove.
Make sure to update the $targetpath variable to your Disabled Accounts AD Path, or wherever you want disabled accounts to go.
